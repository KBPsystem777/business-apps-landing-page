## Status

Draft

## Context

BusinessApps needs a landing page that clearly articulates its value proposition as a product studio for "boring" businesses. The page must reflect the core philosophy of clarity over digital transformation and use a specific theme inspired by Taylor Swift's 1989 (Taylor's Version).

## Goals

- Establish a clear brand identity (Not just a studio, but a builder of repeatable systems).
- Communicate core operating principles (Owner-first, mobile-first, PH internet reality).
- Implement a custom light-mode theme using the requested color palette.
- Provide clear, operator-led CTAs.

## Scope

- Theme configuration (Tailwind & CSS).
- Implementation of the landing page components (Hero, Operating Principles, Differentiation, CTA).
- Content alignment with CEO mentor feedback ("Systems, not software", "Owner exits the store").

## Out of Scope

- Dark mode support (specifically requested to be light mode only).
- Complex backend integrations.
- External product demos (placeholders or inquiries only).
